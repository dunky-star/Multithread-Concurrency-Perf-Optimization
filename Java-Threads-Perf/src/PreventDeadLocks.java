/*
 * This program demonstrates how to prevent deadlocks in a multi-threaded environment.
 * Two trains (TrainA and TrainB) are trying to pass through an intersection that has two roads (roadA and roadB).
 * Each train needs to lock both roads to pass through the intersection.
 * The program uses synchronized blocks to ensure that the locks are acquired in a consistent order,
 * and enforcing a strick order on the lock acquisition (This prevents deadlocks from occurring).
